# Reading-the-brain

Final project for the Building AI course project

## Summary

Hi! AI is used normally in a way, that an input is provided to a somehow trained algorythm which in turn provides an output. This is repeated on and on and on, this is the purpose the AI was build for. But what is between the input and the output: it is the trained AI or the AI-brain itself. The AI brain does not become visible to the 'customer'. It may leave the customer uneasy as the answer of the AI is shared only - I see the AI answer but the AI remains in the dark, a black box. With backwards query some AI may show interesting things which may be of some use, e.g. like neural networks for character recognition which use visual pattern as input to produce an output. A backward query may reveal which pattern of the input is more significant than others, training data may be improved based on such results. It may even de-mystify the AI.

## Background

Sometimes, it can be like magic when dealing with AI: it makes me wonder how it has produced such a precise answer to my query. Actually, being at the 'customer-end' of the AI, I see the AI answer and I know the tool has been somehow trained and all the accumulated training is the basis for the performance it is delivering. But how does the accumulated precious pile of training look like, could it be visualized, does a secret become visible, does it make sense when I see it?
If it could be visualized, the 'secret' of the AI is revelaed: the brain of the AI is just infront like a picture. That visualized brain may disenchant the AI (make the black box more transparent) and it could help e.g. for better selection of training data.

## How is it used?

It can be used for neural networks which work with visual patterns to have something to look at. In neural networks signals are sent through the network with adjusted weights, based on existing connections the different products are being added up, then the sigmoid function 'fires' the result or not. It is similar for signals travelling backwards, just the sigmoid function to be inversed.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources can be any neural network trained which had visual patterns as input (e.g. handwritten letters from MNIST databas)

## Challenges

to write the code but there may be existing code that can be used / adapted.

## What next?

To show the 'brain' of the AI. Coming back to the beginning, for some AI may be a mystic thing. Showing the brain may de-mystify it. Maybe it can be found that some areas of input is more significant than others, training data may be improved based on such results.
