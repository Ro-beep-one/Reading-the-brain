# Reading-the-brain

Final project for the Building AI course project

## Summary

Hi! AI is used normally in a way, that an input is provided to a somehow trained algorythm which in turn provides an output. This is repeated on and on and on, this is the purpose the AI was build for. But what is between the input and the output is the AI or the AI-brain itself. It does not become visible to the 'customer' and may leave the customer uneasy as the answer of the AI is shared but not the AI (I hear its answers but it remains in the dark). With backwards query some AI may show interesting things (e.g. like neural networks which use visual pattern as input).  


## Background

Sometimes, it can be like magic when dealing with AI: it makes me wonder how it has produced such a precise answer to my query. Actually, being at the 'customer-end' of the AI tool, I see the AI answer and I know the tool has been somehow trained and all the accumulated training is the basis for the performance it is delivering. But how does the accumulated precious pile of training look like, could it be visualized, does a secret become visible, does it make sense when I could see it?
If it could be visualized, the 'secret' is revelaed: the brain of the AI is just infront like a picture. That visualized brain may disenchant the AI or make it even more interesting. At least I would be curious to see it.

## How is it used?

It can be used for neural networks which work with visual patterns to have something to look at. In neural networks signals are sent through the network with adjusted weights, based on existing connections the different products are being added up, then the sigmoid function 'fires' the result or not. It is similar for signals travelling backwards, just the sigmoid function to be inversed.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
